Boilerplate By [Gede Dewo Wahyu M.W](https://github.com/gdwmw) ❤️

## Boilerplate Description 📖

This boilerplate is a web application built using Next.js, which is a React framework for web application development. The boilerplate includes various features such as authentication, theme management, state management, form validation, and more. Additionally, this boilerplate follows the principles of Atomic Design for organizing components.
